# Automation Scripts

The `Script` class is the foundational component for any automated process within the Kraken API. 
It acts as the entry point and primary orchestrator for your automation script's logic, 
providing a structured way to manage its lifecycle and interact with the game world.

## Core Concepts

At its heart, a `Script` is designed to be a long-running process that executes a series of actions and works based off of 
RuneScape's natural tick (0.6s) system. It provides methods for initialization, execution, and termination, allowing you to define the behavior of your automation script
from start to finish.

### Lifecycle Methods

Every `Script` implementation will typically override the following methods:

-   **`onStart()`**: This method is called once when the script is first started. It's the ideal place to perform any initial setup, such as:
    -   Loading configuration settings.
    -   Initializing variables.
    -   Setting up event listeners.
    -   Displaying initial GUI elements.

-   **`loop()`**: This is the core execution method of the script. It's called repeatedly in a continuous loop every game tick as long as the script is running. Within `loop()`, you'll typically:
    -   Check the current state of the game.
    -   Determine the next action to take.
    -   Execute game interactions (e.g., clicking, walking, using items).
    -   Manage the flow of your script's logic.

-   **`onStop()`**: This method is called once when the script is stopped, either manually by the user or programmatically. Use `onStop()` to:
    -   Clean up resources (e.g., closing files, releasing network connections).
    -   Save any persistent data.
    -   Remove event listeners.
    -   Display final messages or statistics.

## Script Loop

The script's methodology warrants particular notice. The loop method operates asynchronously with each game tick, 
making it safe for `SleepService` and `Thread.sleep()` calls. Due to its asynchronous execution, calls will not run on the client thread unless the `Context` object is utilized.

For example:

```java
@Singleton
public class MyScript extends Script {
    
    @Inject
    private Context ctx;
    
    @Inject
    private SleepService sleepService;
    
    @Override
    public int loop() {
        String playerName = ctx.runOnClientThread(() -> ctx.getClient().getLocalPlayer().getName());
        
        if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("foo")) {
            sleepService.sleep(1000);
            return 0;
        }
        
        return 600;
    }
}
```

The entire query and service API's are designed to be thread-safe, so any queries, filters, method calls, or interactions can be run on non-client threads. When
callable methods need to execute on RuneLite's client thread, they will be scheduled there, blocking until the method executes.
This helps ensure your plugin code is fully thread-safe, predictable, and easy to read.

The loop method returns an integer which can be used to sleep the script for the specified number of milliseconds. Since the loop method is only called
once every game tick (0.6 seconds) any value less than 600 will execute on the next game tick regardless. You can use the return value of the loop
to sleep various durations depending on your scripts actions and requirements.

## Extending `Script` with the Loop and Task System

While you can implement all your logic directly within `loop()`, for more complex scripts, this can quickly lead to 
unmanageable and difficult-to-debug code. Kraken provides a powerful **Loop and Task system** to help you structure your script's logic in a modular and maintainable way.

The Loop and Task system encourages breaking down your script's overall goal into smaller, discrete units of work called `Task`s. 
These tasks are then managed and executed by the `Loop` within your `Script`.

### The `Task` Interface

The `Task` interface defines the contract for any individual unit of work your script needs to perform. It typically includes methods like:

-   **`validate()`**: This method determines if the task is currently applicable or ready to be executed. For example, a "chop tree" task might validate if there's a tree nearby and if the player has an axe.
-   **`execute()`**: This method contains the actual logic for performing the task. Following the "chop tree" example, this would involve clicking the tree and waiting for the chopping animation.

### The `AbstractTask` Class
 
The Kraken API provides an `AbstractTask` class that offers a convenient base implementation with the game `Context` pre-injected for your tasks.

### Integrating Tasks into Your `Script`

To use the Loop and Task system, your `Script` will typically maintain a list of `Task` objects. In your `loop()` method, you'll iterate through these tasks, validate them, and execute the first valid task.

Here's a conceptual example of how you might structure a `Script` using `Task`s:

```java
import com.kraken.script.Script;
import com.kraken.task.Task;
import com.kraken.task.AbstractTask;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MyBotScript extends Script {

    private List<Task> tasks = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        log.info("MyBotScript started!");
        // Initialize and add your tasks
        tasks.add(new WalkToBankTask());
        tasks.add(new DepositItemsTask());
        tasks.add(new WithdrawItemsTask());
        tasks.add(new ChopTreeTask());
        // ... add more tasks in order of priority or logical flow
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoop() {
        for (Task task : tasks) {
            if (task.validate()) {
                log.debug("Executing task: " + task.getClass().getSimpleName());
                task.execute();
                // After executing a task, we typically break to re-evaluate tasks in the next loop iteration
                // This ensures that higher-priority tasks are always checked first.
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onStop() {
        log.info("MyBotScript stopped!");
        // Perform any cleanup
    }
}
```

By using the Loop and Task system, you achieve:

-   **Modularity**: Each task is a self-contained unit of logic.
-   **Readability**: It's easier to understand what your script is doing by looking at its individual tasks.
-   **Maintainability**: Changes to one task are less likely to affect others.
-   **Testability**: Individual tasks can be tested in isolation.
-   **Flexibility**: You can easily reorder, add, or remove tasks to change your script's behavior.
