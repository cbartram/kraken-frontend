# Accessing Client Logs

Knowing how to access your RuneLite client logs is important because many times issues with plugins will not be 
able to be debugged without the log files. Often times staff members may ask for you to provide logs when troubleshooting
plugin or client problems.

## Windows OS
- Press the `⊞ Win + R` keys on your keyboard
- Copy & Paste `%userprofile%\.runelite\logs` into the run field
- Hit 'OK', this will load up your Runelite logs folder
- Please send the most recent client.log or client file (the file without a date in the file name) to an Admin or Developer

## Mac OS

- Open the Finder application
- Press `⇧ + ⌘ + G (Shift + CMD + G)`
- Copy & paste ~/.runelite/logs in the pop-up box
- Hit the Enter key. This will load up your Runelite logs folder
- Please send the most recent client.log or client file (the file without a date in the file name) to an Admin or Developer

> :warning: **Do not send your client logs to unknown people, or post them in public chat channels; they may contain sensitive information.**
