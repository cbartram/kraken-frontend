## Licenses

Kraken plugins require licenses to activate. Read more about [licensing here](license.md).

## Hardware Locks

Kraken's plugins all implement a Hardware-ID (HWID) locks. This means that when you sign in to the Kraken client for the first time
a unique Hardware ID will be generated based on your motherboard, CPU, GPU, and operating system. This ID is used to lock your
discord account to your specific computer. This is a security precaution put in place to prevent account and plugin sharing.

If you try to log in to your account from another machine (a laptop or friends computer for example) you may receive this message:

![hwid-lock](../images/hardware-id-error.png)

which simply means your hardware ID is locked to another device and your plugin will not load. You can reach out to the [kraken support channel](../support/contact.md) in
Discord for help getting additional hardware ID's added or reset.
