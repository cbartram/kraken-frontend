# Third Party Plugin Policy

Many 3rd party plugins from the plugin hub break the Kraken client in subtle or not-so-subtle ways, including causing issues like client freezes.
We do not support 3rd party plugin providers at this time because we do not make or quality control them. We understand this causes an inconvenience
when switching between 3rd party plugin providers for different suites of plugins but in order to keep your account safe we do not allow non-vetted third party plugins.

Kraken plugins are all engineered by Kraken's owner and have been vetted to be safe and work with the Kraken client.

## Troubleshooting

Launch RuneLite in safe mode using the following command: `"%localappdata%\runelite\runelite.exe" --safe-mode`

This temporarily disables all 3rd party plugins, which will allow you to confirm if the issue is caused by a 3rd party plugin and isn't a core RuneLite issue.
If the issue is caused by a 3rd party plugin, you should isolate which plugin it is and then uninstall the plugin.
