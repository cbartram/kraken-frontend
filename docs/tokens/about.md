# Tokens

Kraken plugins are purchased through Kraken Tokens. Kraken tokens allow for a single currency to be used to purchase
all plugins making it easier to handle sales, refunds, and pricing on the backend.

# Plugin Durations

Tokens can be used to purchase plugins for a given duration one of either:

- 1 month
- 3 month
- 1 year
- lifetime

Plugins are not purchasable through traditional currencies like USD or Euro and are only available through tokens. After
the plugin expires then you will need to use additional tokens to re-activate the plugin and continue using it.

# Purchasing Tokens

For more information on purchasing tokens see [this document](purchasing.md).
