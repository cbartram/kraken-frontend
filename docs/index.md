# Kraken Plugins Documentation

Kraken Plugins are a suite of installable plugins fully compatible with RuneLite which extend your client's capabilities
by showing new overlays for bosses, skilling, and pvp. The plugins are designed to help you tackle the content you are interested
in and go beyond RuneLite's restrictive plugin approval process. Kraken is built on top of RuneLite but extends it with the ability
to load the suite of Kraken plugins enabling new levels of gameplay!

## Features

This means Kraken Plugins can do things like:
- Show you Olm's current rotation
- Help you memorize the Sotetseg maze
- Highlight the correct tile for insanity Wardens
- Show you projectile splatter locations for Araxxor
- Make interfaces large and clickable for smithing
- Automatically pray and gear swap for certain bosses
- and more!

Kraken's plugins are mostly overlay based and designed to assist you with in game tasks rather than fully automate them.
This **drastically** reduces your chance of getting banned and is a really nice middle ground between standard RuneLite
plugins and full on automated bots. This doesn't mean that Kraken doesn't provide you with automation though! In fact, 
Kraken plugins can automate prayer switching, gear swaps, spell casting, thrall summons, and so much more with the open
source API.

If you are interested in contributing or using the API for your own plugins check out the [documentation here](api/intro.md).
