## Installation

The following sections will walk you through installing the client on your computer so you can launch Old School RuneScape
and use the Kraken plugins.

### Windows

If you are on Windows double-click the executable (`.exe`) file that was downloaded and run through the installation process to install the client 
to your RuneLite directory. The installer will take care of setting everything up for you and Kraken plugins will now load alongside
RuneLite. 

You can launch RuneLite as you normally would through either the Jagex Launcher or Desktop Icon.

- Move the downloaded `Kraken-Launcher-2.7.6.jar` file to the installation folder
- Delete `RuneLite.jar`
- Rename `Kraken-Launcher-2.7.6.jar` to `RuneLite.jar`
